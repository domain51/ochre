# 
# A simple utility method for answering whether a given module should call
# `run` or not.
#
# The following JavaScript and Python are roughly equivalent in Node.js.
#
# JavaScript:
#   if (module === require.main)
#
# Python:
#   if __name__ == '__main__':
#
# The caveat to this is if the file is run directly via the `coffee` script.
# In that case the `module` that is passed in is not the same as if it were
# being invoked from within Node.js, thus the check of the final characters in
# the `module.id`.
# 
exports.shouldRun: exports.shouldRun: (module) ->
    module == require.main or module.id[-17..module.id.length] == 'lib/coffee-script'
